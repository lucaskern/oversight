# oversight
Shared codebase for Oversight: An Interactive mini game experience for all ages.

Project Goal: Educate and entertain our target audience (9-20) with simple and addictive small game experiences
After the fun, users will be eductated on how the game they played was designed to be addictive and how that mechanic translates to their day to day online activities. We want players to leave with an understanding of how design works psychologically and how to counteract some common design "tricks".

Developers: Lucas Kern & Philip Petronis
